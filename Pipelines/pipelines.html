        Setting up CI / CD pipelines can be tedious and cumbersome. 
        Especially when it comes to read through the documentation and setting up all needed tools and services. 
        At SAP there is not one combined entry point for developers to get needed information. 
        So setting up a pipeline requires reading through tons of documentations of different tools and setting these up separately. 
        That leads to frustration and developers loose a lot of productivity time.

      <p>
        The whole project started based on an initial research where we drew out several problem spaces regarding the internal developer experience.
        We conducted interviews with over 40 developers to define areas where we as a company had the chance to improve.
        <br><br>One outcome with a huge business value was the missing tooling support to set up the initial infrastructure for development teams so that they are able to build and ship products efficiently.
        After defining these problems spaces we conducted workshops with management and stakeholders to define an ux strategy with which we could tackle these problems.
        <br><br>While creating and validating several user journeys to try out different approaches, we wanted to reduce the cognitive load of developers as much as possible.
        After some intense weeks of testing, validating flows and prototypes we iterated quickly and came up with a solution which was able to reduce the effort for developers to set up pipelines from days to minutes.

        Using the new self-service tool reduces effort for developers from days to minutes and gives them more time focussing on developing awesome software.
        <br>
        We enable developers to setup and customise their pipeline according to their project setup and needs while still fulfilling all corporate standards within SAP.
        <br>
        The template based approach allows all developers to set up their pipelines based on different criterias like orchestrators, development language & application type.
